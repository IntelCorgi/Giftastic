This app allows users to search animal gifs that will pause on a click.

--pseudocode--

HTML Elements:
	- Header that contains all the buttons at the top
		- Maybe use bootstrap
	- Area that the gifs are displayed in.
	- Aside that contains a search bar.

JS Elements
	- Array that contains subjects that will be on the buttons
		- Star Wars
		- The Office
		- Michigan State
		- Corgis
		- Space
		- Parks and Rec
		- Arrested Development
		- DJ Khaled
	- For loop that generates buttons
	- On click for each button ==> generate 10 gifs
		- MUST GENERATE AS PAUSED, then start on click.
	- Search bar
		- Takes user input, and then creates a button using their input.
			- Idea: add text to array???
